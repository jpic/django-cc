## Code Style
### Python
- [pep8]
- [pep20]
- [pep257]
- [pep287]

### Django
We embrace the [django coding style] with the following additions.

#### Apps
Apps should be named according to the system they contain. If there is no system name you may use the plural of the main model's name.

#### Models
Models are defined according to the [django coding style] with the addition of [choices]. Choices are declared right above the corresponding field. The field default is set using a choices attribute.

#### Forms
We declare `ModelForm`s just like we do `Model`s.

#### Templates
Templates are located in the following directory structure: `/{app_name}/templates/{app_name}/` Every template should be named `{model_name}_{template_name_suffix}`, eg:

```
customer_create.html
customer_update.html
customer_detail.html
```

All templates of an app should share a common ancestor or not extend from any
template at all when possible. An example way of complying would be to make all
of the `{app_name}/customer_{create,update,detail}.html` templates to inherit from `{%
extend '{app_name}/base.html' %}`.

##### URL patterns
- All apps should use url **namespaces**, the namespace should be identical to the app name.
- Patterns should be in a separate line than the view and name.
- We do not use view decorators in the url configuration.
- We follow the [django admin][reversing-admin-urls] url pattern, and
- [djangorestframework][drf-routers] url name pattern.

Example:

```python
from . import views

urlpatterns = patterns(
    'customers.views',
    url(r'^customer/$',
     views.CustomerListView.as_view(), name='customer-list'),
    url(r'^customer/create',
     views.CustomerCreateView.as_view(), name='customer-create'),
    url(r'^customer/(?P<pk>\d+)/$',
     views.CustomerDetailView.as_view(), name='customer-detail'),
    url(r'^customer/(?P<pk>\d+)/update',
     views.CustomerUpdateView.as_view(), name='customer-update'),
)
```

## Releases
### Versioning
Versioning happens as defined in [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) by Tom Preston-Werner.

Remember, changed or new features are never to be pushed in a bug fix version, but allow people to update without care.

### Tags
Every release is to be tagged with the version number.

Example:
```bash
git tag v2.3.1
git push --tags
```

### Changelog
An overview over all changes in new version should be available at all times and distributed with both source code and binary bundles.
All changes should be listed and grouped by bug fixed, new and changed features. References to tickets are to be added if available to allow user to read up on design decisions.

Example for a `CHANGELOG.md` file:
```Mardown
# v2.3.1 _latest_
- Fixes #1234 -- Nasty bug making the whole thing freeze
- Fixes #1244 -- Yet another issue

# v2.3.0
- Changes #1129 -- Switched important engine
- Adds #459 -- Support for that amazing new feature
- Fixes #1245 -- Yet another issue
```

### Django version support
This project officially support the latest version of Django only. This allows for a more rapid development and reduces code complexity.

People looking for support for an older Django version, may use an older release that supported the Django version in question.
